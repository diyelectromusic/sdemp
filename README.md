# Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects

This repository houses the code for my Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects website - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/.

# Installation

For individual project installation, choose the project you want to run from the src/SDEMP area, select the .ino file (and any others in the same area) and right click on the "raw" button to save it to your Arduino src area.  Files must be stored in a directory with the same name as the .ino file or the Arduino environment won't like it.

To install all project files into your Arduino src area, select "code" and "download ZIP".  Extract and copy the SDEMP directory over to your Arduino src folder.

If you like what you see, you can buy me a Ko-Fi - https://ko-fi.com/diyelectromusic

# Support

I do not offer support for any of these projects, there are provided "as is" (see license).

But I will attempt to answer any queries posted to a public forum.  More here: https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/support/.

#  A Word of Caution!

Be particularly wary about plugging any of these circuits described in these projects into your expensive computers, audio, musical or electronic equipment - I don't recommend it so you do so at your own risk! And make sure you double check everything first regardless. My background is embedded software and music, not electronics, so any electronics information I present is on a "well, I found it somewhere on the Internet and it sort of works for me" basis only!

An old, second-hand or hand-me-down music keyboard, computer and amplification are well worth the investment for experimenting - that is what I use for everything.

This is the store for source code associated with my blog, so I'm not really after contributions at this time.  But feel free to get in touch if you spot something wrong! :)
