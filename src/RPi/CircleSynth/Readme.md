## Raspberry Pi Bare Metal Synthesis Experiments

This repository houses the code for my Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects website - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/.  In particular it contains the code for my experiments in "bare metal" programming on the Raspberry Pi.

It is built on the excellent Circle environment by Rene Stange: https://github.com/rsta2/circle
