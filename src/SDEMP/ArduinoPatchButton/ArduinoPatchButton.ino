  MIDI.begin(MIDI_CHANNEL_OFF);

  // This updates speed of the serial channel so that it can be used
  // with a PC rather than a MIDI port.

  // This can be used with software such as the Hairless MIDI Bridge
  // and loopMidi during testing.

    // MIDI presents voices as numbers 1-128 to the user
    // but they need converting to 0-127 for sending.
